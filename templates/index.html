<h2>The Pancake Flipper</h2>
<div>
<div class="jumbotron">
  <div class="container text-center">
<p>Last year, the Infinite House of Pancakes introduced a new kind of pancake. It has a happy face made of chocolate chips on one side (the "happy side"), and nothing on the other side (the "blank side").

You are the head cook on duty. The pancakes are cooked in a single row over a hot surface. As part of its infinite efforts to maximize efficiency, the House has recently given you an oversized pancake flipper that flips exactly K consecutive pancakes. That is, in that range of K pancakes, it changes every happy-side pancake to a blank-side pancake, and vice versa; it does not change the left-to-right order of those pancakes.

You cannot flip fewer than K pancakes at a time with the flipper, even at the ends of the row (since there are raised borders on both sides of the cooking surface). For example, you can flip the first K pancakes, but not the first K - 1 pancakes.

Your apprentice cook, who is still learning the job, just used the old-fashioned single-pancake flipper to flip some individual pancakes and then ran to the restroom with it, right before the time when customers come to visit the kitchen. You only have the oversized pancake flipper left, and you need to use it quickly to leave all the cooking pancakes happy side up, so that the customers leave feeling happy with their visit.

Given the current state of the pancakes, calculate the minimum number of uses of the oversized pancake flipper needed to leave all pancakes happy side up, or state that there is no way to do it.
<br><br>
Please give a row of pancakes. x for smiley pancake and o for a plain pancake. The k represents the size of the flipper. It should be an integer larger than 1 and smaller than number of pancakes

      <p>I am a bachelor Software Engineering student at Linnaeus Universitet in Sweden.
        I am currently living in San Francisco Bay Area, doing an exchange program at
        California State University East Bay. My main interests include sofware development,
        database systems, computer science, web development, entrepreneurship, and mobile
         development. In my free time I like to swim, read all sorts of books, program and
          travel around the world. I am currently looking for an internship or entry position
           in the Bay Area!.
           Before I embarked myself in this fascinating enterprise that Software engineering
           is, I experienced life and travel all around the world. Here I am now, late but sure,
            pursuing a new dream in California.</p>

      <p>Arnthor Helgi Sverrisson: I'm from Reykjavik Iceland. I did my bachelor
        in Software Engineering in the University of Iceland. Currently I'm studying
        masters in Computer Science in Uppsala University in Uppsala Sweden.
        I'm taking Advanced Computer Science Studies in Sweden, Data Mining and
         Artificial Intelligence. I'm interested in machine learning and working
         with data. I intend to further my studies in this field here in Uppsala
          University. I also like web and mobile app development. my interests
          are travelling, watching and playing sports and programming.

      <p>My name is Iosif Kakalelis and I’m coming from Greece. I finished my bachelor degree of Applied Informatics in the University of Macedonia in Thessaloniki. My previous studies combined computer science with business, accounting and economics. I chose Uppsala because there is a wide range of courses you can pick and much freedom to shape your own study program. I still don’t know what to do after graduation but among my interests so far in IT is programming, software engineering and software development. I’d prefer a future career to a company rather than an academic career. Mathematics isn’t my strongest point; therefore, I’d like more to work with applied projects like business apps. Moreover, I have a 3-month internship experience in a company, where I was asked to develop a web app as a part of a group project. Finally, my expectation here is to fill the gaps I have by taking courses that weren’t included in my bachelor and improve or revise my current knowledge.</p>
